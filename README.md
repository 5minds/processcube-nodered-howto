This is a [ProcessCube App](https://processcube.io/) project bootstrapped with [`create-processcube-app`](https://processcube.io/docs/app-sdk/create-processcube-app).

## Getting Started

If the app contains a `docker-compose.yml` file, you should first bring up the corresponding Docker containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

After that, you can build and start the app with the following commands:

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```

For local development, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
